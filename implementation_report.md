# ViEduChain-Hino - Implementation Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the requested features for the ViEduChain-Hino blockchain project.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed the "addr not deployed" error
- Created `fix_contract_addresses.py` to resolve contract address issues
- The script ensures contract addresses from the JSON files are correctly loaded
- Creates environment files for Docker containers
- Updates docker-compose.yml to include environment variables
- Sets environment variables directly in running containers
- Restarts API containers to apply changes
- Includes API endpoint testing to verify address resolution

### 2. Added new pages to the sidebar in the frontend
Added three new pages to the frontend sidebar navigation:
- **Certificates**: For managing and verifying educational certificates
- **Course Completion**: For recording and verifying course completion records
- **Degree Issuance**: For issuing and verifying academic degrees

Implementation details:
- Updated the navigation configuration in `fe/src/app/layout.tsx`
- Created corresponding page components with full functionality:
  - `fe/src/app/certificates/page.tsx`
  - `fe/src/app/course-completion/page.tsx`
  - `fe/src/app/degree-issuance/page.tsx`
- All pages include forms for creating records and tables for displaying/verifying existing records
- Implemented API integration for all CRUD operations

### 3. Created a comprehensive data generator script
Created `data_generator.py` with the following features:
- Generates test data for all ViEduChain-Hino modules:
  - EduID (DIDs)
  - EduCert (Certificates, Course Completions, Degrees)
  - EduPay (Wallets, Transfers)
  - EduMarket (NFTs)
  - EduAdmission (Seats, Scores)
  - ResearchLedger (Research Publications)
- Configurable number of records to generate
- Module-specific data generation
- Dry-run mode for previewing operations
- Logging and error handling
- Saves generated data to a JSON file for reference

## Usage Instructions

### Fix Contract Addresses
To fix the "addr not deployed" error:
```bash
python fix_contract_addresses.py
```

### Generate Test Data
To generate test data for the system:
```bash
# Generate data for all modules
python data_generator.py

# Generate specific number of records
python data_generator.py --count 20

# Generate data for a specific module
python data_generator.py --module eduid

# Preview operations without making API calls
python data_generator.py --dry-run
```

### Accessing the New Pages
After starting the frontend application, the new pages can be accessed through the sidebar navigation:
- Certificates
- Course Completion
- Degree Issuance

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using:
- Next.js for the framework
- Refine for data handling and admin panel features
- Ant Design for UI components

### Data Structure
The data generator creates structured records that match the expected API format:

1. **Certificates**:
   - Student DID
   - Certificate Type
   - Certificate Name
   - Issue Date
   - Issuer DID
   - Metadata

2. **Course Completions**:
   - Student DID
   - Course ID
   - Course Name
   - Completion Date
   - Grade
   - Credits
   - Instructor DID
   - Institution DID
   - Metadata

3. **Degrees**:
   - Student DID
   - Degree Name
   - Degree Type
   - Major
   - Graduation Date
   - GPA
   - Honors
   - Institution DID
   - Signature Authority
   - Metadata

### API Integration
All generated components and scripts integrate with the existing API endpoints, maintaining consistency with the current architecture.

## Conclusion
The implemented features enhance the ViEduChain-Hino platform by:
1. Ensuring reliable contract address handling
2. Expanding the UI with essential educational credential management features
3. Providing tools to easily populate the system with test data

These improvements make the system more robust, functional, and easier to test and demonstrate.
