## Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
A DPIA will be conducted to assess risks related to personal data processing and to implement measures to mitigate those risks.

## Conclusion
This GDPR mapping document will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure ongoing compliance as the EduChain project evolves. All stakeholders are encouraged to familiarize themselves with GDPR requirements and the measures implemented within EduChain to protect personal data.
