# EduChain REST API Enhancements

## Summary of Changes

We've enhanced the EduChain REST API with the following improvements:

1. **Added New Endpoints**:
   - Credential endpoints (`/api/v1/credentials`, `/api/v1/credentials/verify`, `/api/v1/credentials/revoke`)
   - Health check endpoint (`/health`)

2. **Improved Architecture**:
   - Added CORS support for cross-origin requests
   - Implemented structured JSON logging for better observability
   - Added proper error handling and response formatting
   - Moved to a more modern HTTP router with pattern matching

3. **Security Improvements**:
   - Updated Docker image to use multi-stage builds
   - Reduced final image size by using Alpine Linux
   - Added healthcheck to Docker container
   - Added restart policy to deployment script

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md with new endpoint details
   - Created dedicated credential API documentation
   - Improved error response documentation

5. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Created an API tester HTML page for easy endpoint testing

## Next Steps

Here are the recommended next steps for the EduChain REST API:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Add JWT authentication for secure endpoints
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types

2. **Additional Features**:
   - Add pagination support for list endpoints
   - Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Create an OpenAPI specification for automated client generation

3. **Integration with Other Components**:
   - Connect to the IBC relay for cross-chain communication
   - Integrate with the frontend application
   - Add monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana

4. **Scalability**:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add rate limiting to protect against abuse
   - Consider horizontal scaling for high availability

5. **Testing**:
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Running the API

To run the updated REST API:

```bash
cd be/educhain/deployments/devnet
./run_rest_api.sh
```

This will build and start the REST API container. You can then access the API at http://localhost:1318/api/v1/nodeinfo.

To test the API using the provided HTML tester:

1. Open the file `be/educhain/chain/rest/api-tester.html` in a web browser
2. Use the interface to select endpoints and send requests
3. View the response data in the response section

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Check the container logs: `docker logs educhain-rest-api`
- Verify that the container is running: `docker ps | grep educhain-rest-api`
- Check for network connectivity issues: `curl -v http://localhost:1318/health`
